1. DIVA GUI integration, three panels: 'articulatory synthesizer', 'DIVA simulation panel', 'Target creation panel'
2. add constriction display to 'articulatory synthesizer' panel and make user-controllable
     Ricky: add new panel, identical behavior/organization as formants, display test.state.Som output of diva_synth (first 6 values)
     Alfonso: pseudoinverse solution in diva_solveinv('target_somatosensory',) ... 
3a. add checkbox for "restrained" articulators (note: mix with Simulink constrictions)
3b. 'Keep VT open' checkbox for constrained optimization (when solving for formant targets)
4. create new "create target" dialog box to import info from 'Articulatory Synthesizer' to 'Target creation panel'
5. vocal tract intersections shown as darker gray
DONE 6. create dialog box to enter formant values simultaneously.
