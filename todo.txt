1. DIVA GUI integration, three panels: 'articulatory synthesizer', 'DIVA simulation panel', 'Target creation panel'
DONE 2. add constriction display to 'articulatory synthesizer' panel and make user-controllable
DONE      Ricky: add new panel, identical behavior/organization as formants, display test.state.Som output of diva_synth (first 6 values)
DONE      Alfonso: pseudoinverse solution in diva_solveinv('target_somatosensory',) ... 
DONE 3a. add checkbox for "restrained" articulators (note: mix with Simulink constrictions)
DONE 3b. 'Keep VT open' checkbox for constrained optimization (when solving for formant targets)
DONE 4. create new "create target" dialog box to import info from 'Articulatory Synthesizer' to 'Target creation panel'
DONE 5. vocal tract intersections shown as darker gray
DONE 6. create dialog box to enter formant values simultaneously.
